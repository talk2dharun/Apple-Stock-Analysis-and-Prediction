# Apple-Stock-Analysis-and-Prediction
My project name is "Apple Stock Analysis and Prediction", where I analyzed Apple's historical stock data from 1980 to 2025 and developed predictive models to forecast adjusted closing prices. This project integrates data visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to derive insights into Apple's stock performance.
